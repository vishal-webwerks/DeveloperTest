This repository contains solution for the given four questions in core java.
Question 1: Colors can be represented using cylindrical coordinates, in a model named HSV. Say you have a very long vector of HSV color tuples (unordered) defned as (h, s, v) where h is the hue in degrees [0°, 360°), s and v are saturation and value, respectively, in percentage. Your objective is to obtain all pairs of complementary colors from this vector. The complementary color of (h, s, v) is defned as (h + 180°, s, v). How would you implement a function to perform this operation in the most optimized way?

Example: Given the input vector {(195°, 11%, 12%), (37°, 13%, 76%), (15°, 11%, 12%)} you should return the pair {(15°, 11%, 12%), (195°, 11%, 12%)}.

Question 2: Design a Tic-Tac-Toe game on an NxN grid for P players. The game can be played by two or more players, and the grid size N > 1 can be set freely. The software architect is expecting to get a function move(x, y, player) → result, where x is the column and y is the row. The player parameter can be any representation of the player making the move, and the result represents one of the three cases: nobody won yet, the player that just made the move has won or the game has no more valid moves (the grid is complete). Case the player is willing to make an invalid move (over an already occupied position), the function raises an exception. This game is intended to run on very low-end devices, so design a reasonably eficient solution!

Question 3: Can you implement a “computer” player for the game above?

Question 4: What do you feel you do best at work?
